# Project3_AP_KNTU  

## Description  
**Project3_AP_KNTU** is the continuation of **Project2_AP_KNTU**, developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course at **KNTU**. This project expands upon the features and functionalities of its predecessor by introducing improved software design, enhanced performance, and additional capabilities.  

The project follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and utilizes advanced Java concepts such as multithreading, GUI development (if applicable), and optimized data structures.  

## Features  
- **Enhanced Object-Oriented Design** – Improved class structures, better encapsulation, and modular design.  
- **Optimized Data Structures** – More efficient use of lists, maps, and other collections.  
- **Multithreading Support** – Improved performance through concurrent execution (if applicable).  
- **GUI Implementation** – (If included) A user-friendly graphical interface for better interaction.  
- **Persistence & File Handling** – Storing and retrieving data efficiently.  
- **Error Handling & Exception Management** – Improved stability and robustness.
